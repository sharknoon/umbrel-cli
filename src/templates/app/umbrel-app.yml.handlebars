# The app manifest YAML file tells Umbrel details about our app such as the name, description, dependencies, port number to access the app, etc.

# There are currently two manifest versions: 1 and 1.1. Version 1 is the basic version and is sufficient for most apps.
# However, if your app requires the use of hooks (scripts that are run at different stages of the app lifecycle), you need to use version 1.1.
# Hooks allow you to perform custom actions at different stages of the app's lifecycle, such as before the app starts (pre-start), after the
# app installs (post-install), and more. If your app doesn't need to use hooks, you can stick with manifest version 1.
